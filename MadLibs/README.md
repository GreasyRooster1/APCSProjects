# MadLibs

## Design Notes
I plan on using identifiers like ```{0}```

The code will have a list of question words that use the number inside the identifier as the index of the question word

when the user enters their input it replaces the identifier

## Milestone

 - Started working on this
 - Added my story and question words
 - Used loop to fill in with user input
 - added the stories i have to include for some reason

## Description 
this program lets the user pick a story and fill in the madlibs for it
