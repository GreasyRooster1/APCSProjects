# MadLibs

## Design Notes
I plan on using identifiers like ```{0}```

The code will have a list of question words that use the number inside the identifier as the index of the question word

when the user enters their input it replaces the identifier

## Milestone

 - Started working on this (est 5 minutes, actual 5 minutes)
 - Added my story and question words (est 15 minutes, actual 10 minutes)
 - Used loop to fill in with user input (est 45 minutes, actual 30 minutes)
 - added the stories i have to include for some reason (est 5 minutes, actual 5 minutes)
 - added the other stuff that overcomplicates this (est 10 minutes, actual 20 minutes)

## Description 
this program lets the user pick a story and fill in the madlibs for it
